#Conference Planner#
**the problem** Parent teacher conferences for each grade level and for each teacher are planned by a peice of paper. This makes it hard to keep track of the updates for parents and teachers.

**the solution** An online signup that updates in real time and can have email reminder interaction

**concerns for users**

_parents_
* see what times for each child
* sign up at a time that best suits them
* see what time signed up for
* reminded what time signed up for
* change time signed up for

_Teachers_
* need to be able to see which students at what times
* be able to block out times for lunch
* sign up parents who havent on an availabile slot
